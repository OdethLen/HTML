Look,	I	didn’t	want	to	be	a	half-blood.
If	you’re	reading	this	because	you	think	you	might	be	one,	my	advice	is:	close
this	book	right	now.	Believe	whatever	lie	your	mom	or	dad	told	you	about	your
birth,	and	try	to	lead	a	normal	life.
Being	a	half-blood	is	dangerous.	It’s	scary.	Most	of	the	time,	it	gets	you	killed
in	painful,	nasty	ways.
If	you’re	a	normal	kid,	reading	this	because	you	think	it’s	fiction,	great.	Read
on.	I	envy	you	for	being	able	to	believe	that	none	of	this	ever	happened.
