            <h2> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </h2>
            <hr>
         <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">
            Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For
            one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any
            other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his
            homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of
            night. And he also happened to be a wizard.

            It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in
            bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a
            flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A
            History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open
            against the pillow.
