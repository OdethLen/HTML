            I've grown a mouth so sharp and cruel
            It's all that I can give to you my dear
            And when you come in quick to steal a kiss
            My teeth will only cut your lips, my dear

            And I know that you mean so well
            But I am not a vessel for your good intent

            I will only break your pretty things
            I will only wring you dry of everything
            But if you're fine with that
            You can be mine like that
